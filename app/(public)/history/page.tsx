            The Catholic Diocese of Katsina was officially established on Monday, 16th October 2023, as announced from the Vatican. His Holiness Pope Benedict appointed Reverend Monsignor Gerald Mamman Musa as its first Bishop. Prior to this, he served as an Associate Professor of Communications at the Catholic Institute of West Africa (CIWA), Port Harcourt.

          <p>
            This new jurisdiction was carved out of the former Diocese of Sokoto which previously encompassed Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara states. The Diocese of Katsina now includes all of Katsina State and the Kaura Namoda region of Zamfara, covering approximately 25,060 km² in northwestern Nigeria.

          <p>
            The Catholic roots in the region trace as far back as 1870, when Franciscan priests from Agadez (Niger Republic) visited areas within modern-day Katsina. Though their mission was brief, it set the stage for future efforts.

          <p>
            In November 1921, Father Berengario Cermenatti (SMA) arrived in Sokoto from Zaria, sparking more organized missionary activities. While Argungu and Sokoto were primary stations, Funtua and Gusau became important stops along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            By June 19, 1953, Sokoto and Katsina provinces were transferred from Kaduna Prefecture and placed under the administration of Dominican Friars from Chicago. Six missions were soon established—three in Sokoto (Gusau, Sokoto, Yelwa) and three in Katsina (Funtua, Katsina, Malumfashi).

          <h3>Key Parishes</h3>

          <p><strong>Funtua:</strong> Once an outstation of Zaria, it witnessed its first baptism in 1929. By 1960, it had a church building and resident priest, Fr. Bell, who engaged the Hausa community in evangelization.</p>

          <p><strong>Malumfashi:</strong> Became an outstation in 1958. Land was acquired in 1961 and a mission opened in 1962, led by Fr. Richard Farmer OP. The mission prioritized education and healthcare, managed by Dominican Sisters.</p>

          <p><strong>Katsina:</strong> Initially an outstation of Kano, then Gusau, then Funtua. A residence was built in 1964 but the civil war impacted pastoral presence. Despite this, missionary work spread to Dutsin-Ma, Daura, Kankia, Jibia, and Batsari.</p>

          <h3>Rural Outreach and Evangelization</h3>

          <p>
            The opening of St. Joseph Mukasa Catechetical Training Centre in Malumfashi trained catechists across Northern Nigeria. This catalyzed outreach to Hausa communities and fostered lay leadership. Notably, Mallam Mamman Musa, father of Bishop Gerald, was a pioneering catechist.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the early 2000s, new parishes and mass centers emerged in rural Katsina. These include: St. Joseph’s Shagari Low Cost, St. Gabriel’s Daura, St. Mary’s Dutsinma, St. Theresa’s Funtua, St. Vincent Ferrer’s Malumfashi, St. John Bosco’s Malamawa, and many more.
          </p>

          <h3>Current Status</h3>

          <p>
            The Diocese of Katsina has:

          <blockquote>
            “We pray that this Diocese will serve as a rallying point and become the epicentre for the evangelization of Hausaland. On this special day that we celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, we entrust the new Diocese into her maternal care.”
